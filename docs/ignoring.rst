Ignoring files
==============


Files/directories matching ``.gitignore`` entries (global and local) are
automatically ignored, unless specified as paths on the command line.

Currently there are no other methods to add or remove this ignoring logic.
Please open a ticket if you want this feature. Most likely we should try to make
it work like `ripgrep filtering
<https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-globs>`_
if that makes sense.
