Welcome to pyastgrep's documentation!
=====================================

pyastgrep is a command-line utility (and library) for grepping Python files
using XPath syntax (or CSS selectors) against the Python AST (Abstract Syntax
Tree).

In other words, this allows you to search Python code against specific syntax
elements (function definitions, arguments, assignments, variables etc), instead
of grepping for string matches.

The interface and behaviour is designed to match grep and ripgrep as far as it
makes sense to do so.

The project is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/spookylukey/pyastgrep/>`_.
