Editor integration
==================


Emacs
~~~~~

pyastgrep works very well with ``compilation-mode`` and wrappers like
``projectile-compile-project`` from `Projectile
<https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html#basic-usage>`_. We recommend
setting up a keyboard shortcut for ``next-error`` to enable you to step through
results easily.

Visual Studio Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run pyastgrep from a terminal and results will be hyperlinked automatically.
